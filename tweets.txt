My talk on #NGLess at #ISMBECCB #BOSC2019 starts in 7 minutes.

It is in the Delhi room (ground floor). Come over.

For those of you who couldn't make it to my talk (which just started), I will
be live-tweeting it. #ISMBECCB #BOSC2019

#NGLess is a Domain-specific programming language for NGS

I don't actually have a proper citation for the fact that debugging takes a lot
of time, but if you've ever written anything longer than a 2 line script, this
is like asking for a citation for water being wet.

When optimizing code, an important principle is to focus effort on the
bottlenecks, so let's make finding and correcting errors faster.

Speed of processing is not the most important reason to use the software, speed
of getting results is and, for many projects, this depends more on usability
than computational performance. Having said that, #NGLess is actually really
fast! #ISMBECCB #BOSC2019
